# Moosh
This is a game that I'm making for Mac OS X Terminal. Run it with "g++ main.cpp player.cpp map.cpp && ./a.out" or just run "MooshV1.out" with terminal. The Goal is to get to the diamond at the bottom right of the map with the most keys. Use W,A,S,D to move around and E is the action button. Make sure that kapsLock is off on you keyboard. Capital Q will quit the program.
